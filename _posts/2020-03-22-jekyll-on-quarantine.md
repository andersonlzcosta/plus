## Figuring out the break
After Le Wagon's bootcamp, I've been programming with Ruby and mostly Rails a lot. I'm getting pretty confident with Rails framework and interested to learn a new MVC framework, probably written with Python. I'm curious to start coding with a new langague and seems python everywhere and it's similar to Ruby. Even Le Wagon will host a Python drive Data Science bootcamp.

But before I could start doing it, I needed to finish a few projects that was taking too much time. It had a pretty nasty consequence to my free time and to the wealth of my curiosity. The free time covid-19's quaratine allowed me to remember this fun. I played some games as well. I've be missing this quality time.

## Messing around with Jekyll
I've came across to Jekyll several times over the years. I need to upgrade my portifolio and implementing a tiny blog to show some written thoughts for future employers is a nice idea. Turns out that this Ruby projeck with markdown is a nice step toward detoxing from Rails.

It's super nice to finally deploy a headless CMS. I believe I'll keep this turf of the web and pimp it out a bit.


## VIM and Tmux
It's pretty nice how TMUX and VIM is flexible to deal with any stack I throw at it. I kind of fear of Flutter and mobile development. Maybe I should stick with cyber security and backend.
