<p>After Le Wagonâ€™s bootcamp, Iâ€™ve been programming with Ruby and mostly Rails a lot. Iâ€™m getting pretty confident with Rails framework and interested to learn a new MVC framework, probably written with Python. Iâ€™m curious to start coding with a new langague and seems python everywhere and itâ€™s similar to Ruby. Even Le Wagon will host a Python drive Data Science bootcamp.</p>

<p>But before I could start doing it, I needed to finish a few projects that was taking too much time. It had a pretty nasty consequence to my free time and to the wealth of my curiosity. The free time covid-19â€™s quaratine allowed me to remember this fun. I played some games as well. Iâ€™ve be missing this quality time.</p>

<h2 id="messing-around-with-jekyll">Messing around with Jekyll</h2>
<p>Iâ€™ve came across to Jekyll several times over the years. I need to upgrade my portifolio and implementing a tiny blog to show some written thoughts for future employers is a nice idea. Turns out that this Ruby projeck with markdown is a nice step toward detoxing from Rails.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s super nice to finally deploy a headless CMS. I believe Iâ€™ll keep this turf of the web and pimp it out a bit.</p>

<h2 id="vim-and-tmux">VIM and Tmux</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s pretty nice how TMUX and VIM is flexible to deal with any stack I throw at it. I kind of fear of Flutter and mobile development. Maybe I should stick with cyber security and backend.</p>
